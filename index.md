### Data Scientist | Predictive Modeling & Applied Analytics

I apply statistical modeling and machine learning to real-world datasets to uncover meaningful patterns, evaluate risk, and support data-driven decision making. My work often focuses on health and safety-related problems where careful interpretation and responsible analysis are essential.

## About

I am a data science graduate student at Bellevue University and a Medical Laboratory Scientist with five years of experience in clinical environments. Working in high-impact healthcare settings has shaped my interest in using data to understand risk better, improve outcomes, and inform operational decision-making.

Through my academic and applied projects, I focus on predictive modeling, exploratory analysis, and ethical data integration. I am particularly interested in leveraging statistical methods and machine learning to address complex, real-world problems where data-driven insight can meaningfully improve outcomes.

My portfolio reflects a strong emphasis on:

- Predictive modeling (regression & classification)
- Large-scale exploratory data analysis
- Multi-source data integration
- Risk and outcome modeling
- Ethical data interpretation and bias awareness
- Clear communication of analytical results
