# Motorcycle Accident Risk Analysis

This project analyzes large-scale motorcycle accident and injury data from California to identify demographic, temporal, and severity-related risk factors. Using exploratory data analysis and statistical techniques, the analysis uncovers patterns associated with high-risk conditions and accident outcomes. The findings are intended to support data-driven safety interventions and inform public policy efforts aimed at reducing motorcycle-related injuries and fatalities.
